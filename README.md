## Advent of Code 2020

#### Language: JavaScript

## 09/12/2020 update

Today was not bad at all. Still need to tackle the backlog.

### 08/12/2020 update

Today's puzzle was hard, but I got there in the end. Continued using the filesystem module instead of formatting the input as JSON. _Much_ more convenient.

Also, this marks the first push.

I might have broken some part1 solutions while modifying them for part2. I'll try and be better about that in the future and use separate files.

In progress:
- day4, part2
- day5, part2

Missing:
- day7
